# Tool Features
### Batch Animation Creation
Automatically generate multiple animations from a single spritesheet, reducing manual setup time. Define animations using start and end frames, and export them as Unity Animation Clips (.anim).
### Sprite Sheet Swapping
Effortlessly switch between spritesheets that follow the same layout. This feature is for developers working with characters or objects that have multiple skins or states, enabling quick swaps without needing to adjust frame ranges or manually creating or dragging animations.
### Animation List Management
Add, remove, and duplicate animations directly from the tool's UI. Organize your animation sequences efficiently, with support for reordering through intuitive controls.
### Save and Load Presets
Save your animation settings as JSON files for future use. This functionality allows for easy reapplication of animation sequences to new spritesheets, significantly speeding up the development process when working with multiple characters or assets.
### Sprite Library Asset Creation
Streamline the organization of sprites into categories and labels by creating Sprite Library assets directly from your animations. This feature organizes sprites based on animation names and frames, facilitating quick access and reuse within your projects.
